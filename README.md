# Community-Detection-in-Social-Network

As a sample network you can use 'a.dot' network or create a network using SBM.

1) Implement any community detection method we covered.

2) Use three other methods as well. (You can import a module, download a code, just give the source)

3) Measure the Jaccard index between the different methods
