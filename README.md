# Community-Detection-in-Social-Network

As a sample network you can use 'a.dot' network or create a network using SBM.

1) Implement any community detection method we covered.

2) Use three other methods as well. (You can import a module, download a code, just give the source)

3) Measure the Jaccard index between the different methods

## Label Propagation Algorithm
Twelve iterations are visualized, however after Step 4 the numbers of detected communities not changed.

## Girvan-Newman Method
Twelve iteration is visualized based on experimental observation of the given network and the algorithm.

## Hierarchical Clustering
In this method the number of clusters/communities can be defined. Iterated from 1 to 12.

## Spectral Clustering 
In this method the number of clusters/communities can be defined. Iterated from 1 to 12.
